# aaronnn-dot-com

This is aaronnn.com, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v12 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deployed using [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)!

This project is a quick overview of my capabilities, skills, and work experience. Netlify was the ideal choice for this type of project, especially given the vast array of features it offered such as Preview Mode, server-side rendering/incremental static regeneration, and internationalized routing on deploy automatically. The automatic deploy made issuing updates a breeze!
